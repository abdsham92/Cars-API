# Helper script

Includes a script `populate_database.sh` that cleans the database then populates it again.

To use the script `populate_database.sh` you need first to run `helper_script_env_setup.sh` sucessfully once:

```bash
chmod +x helper_script_env_setup.sh
./helper_script_env_setup.sh
```

after that you can run this script as you want

```bash
# make it executable first time only
chmod +x populate_database.sh
# then
./populate_database.sh
```
